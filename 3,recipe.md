How to make a plain pound cake:
1. Mix the pounds of egg, oil, and sugar in one container
2. Keep mixing the mixture
3. Gradually add small portions of the flour to the mixture. Make sure no lumps are formed
4. Once all of the flour has been added in and the batter is ready, pour it into a pan or mold. Then, put it in a preheated oven for about 30 minutes at 180â„ƒ
5. After the time has passed, check if the cake is ready by using a toothpick or something of the sort to poke the cake. If something is sticking to the toothpick, put it back in the oven and bake it for a few more minutes, depending on how much was sticking to the toothpick. If nothing is sticking to the toothpick, take the cake out and let it cool for a while
6. If you haven't already, take the cake out and let it cool. Once it has cooled, you are free to eat it! Hope you like it :)
