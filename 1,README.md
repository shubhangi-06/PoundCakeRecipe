This is folder contains a recipe for a pound cake! As Google puts it, a pound cake is a type of cake traditionally made with a pound of each of four ingredients: flour, butter, eggs, and sugar. They are usually baked in either a loaf pan (rectangular) or a Bundt mold (circular). I've added a few images below of some different pound cakes.
